# Builder Design Pattern

To separate the **construction** of an object from its **representation**

For example image a powerpoint. Once we create a presentation, we go to the file menu
and export to a differente forms (pdf, ppt, images, html, etc).

In this particular example **Construction** is about the exporting logic (the logic for exporting a presentation)
**Representation** on the other hand is the target format (pdf, ppt, kimages, html, etc.).
