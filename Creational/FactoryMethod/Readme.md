# Factory Method Design Pattern

Defer the creation of an object to subclasses.
We create a new class which will return a new object.

For example let's say we want to create a Web Framework, 
so other develpers can use our framework to develop applications.

An example of a web framework is Express.js, ASP.NET MVC/Core, Spring, Django

All frameworks has a concept of a template or a view which is an html file to render data.
Frameworks have a engine to read a template and speed up html content.

The Factory Method pattern relies on inheritance
Using inheritance and polymorphism (override methods) we add flexibility to our design.
not use static methods.

## FACTORY METHOD is a **method**
## ABSTRACT FACTORY is an **abstraction (interface)**
