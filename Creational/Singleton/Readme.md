# Singleton Design Pattern

We use this pattern when we want to ensure a class has only a single instance

We need a single place to store for example settings, logs, etc. in a single object.

Ensure have a single instance of our class by:
1. Make our constructor private
2. Make this class responsible for create the single instance
3. Need an operation or method for getting this single instance (getInstance())
