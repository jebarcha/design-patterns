# Bridge Design Pattern

With the bridge pattern we can build a simple and flexible hierarchy of classes

The problem solved by the **Bridge pattern** is that a hierachy can grow in two differente dimentions
and need to add multiple new classes every time we want to add new implmenetations.

Whenever we have a hierarchy that grows in two different dimentions, We need to split it
in to two separate hierarchies and connected using a **bridge**
This way we can have our code more extensible and maintainable.
