# Adapter Pattern
We use this pattern to convert the interface of a class to a different form.
Just like how we use adapters in everyday life.

We use composition to have our third party object
We can also use inheritance but is not recommended for best practices favor composition over inheritance, 
so it can be more flexible (also because we cannot inherit more than one class in C# in case we need more)
